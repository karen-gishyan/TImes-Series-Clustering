### To do
[X] Understand the metric function from 
https://github.com/tslearn-team/tslearn/blob/a3cf3bf/tslearn/clustering/utils.py#L66-L197
* if not string or none, assumes a callable for distance calculation.
[ ] Understand 
https://tslearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gen_modules/metrics/tslearn.metrics.cdist_dtw.html#tslearn.metrics.cdist_dtw
[ ] The silhouettes match the results (check one more time), but check the plots, to  make sure the right variables are correctly displayed next to each plot.
[ ] Restructure the code, complete readme.
[ ] Next time avoid using pandas as much as possible.
[ ] Include the results for dtw and euclidean.
[ ] Site tslearn, maybe yellow-brick as well.
[ ] make a dataframe from clustered series for both master's and phd to check the consistence of visualization.
[ ] Add x and y series for the clustering plot.
